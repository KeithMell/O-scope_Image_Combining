# O-SCOPE IMAGE PRINTOUT GENERATOR
This program takes the images that the O-scope downloads to USB. 
It inverts, re-sizes, and then combines them. Allowing an easier time filling out the data summary for ECE 200 Lab

## INSTRUCTIONS:
+ Put the OScope_Image_Printout_Generator.exe in a directory with the images you want to combine
+ The names of the images MUST BE UNCHANGED. Meaning, still in the form "scope_1.png", "scope_2.png", etc.
+ Running the program will then create a collage that consists of all the images in the folder with it. 
+ If you have a mac, use the .app instead of .exe

## WARNINGS:
+ Will only combine up to 100 images
+ Running the program will overwrite any existing collages in the same directory
+ Only usable for images downloaded directly from the O-Scope to a USB
