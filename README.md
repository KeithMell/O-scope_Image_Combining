# O-scope Image Combiner
This program takes the images that the O-scope downloads to USB. 
It inverts, resizes, and then combines them. Allowing an easier time filling out the data summary for ECE 200 Lab

## INSTRUCTIONS:
	Put the O-Scope_Resizing_And_Inverting.exe in a directory with the images you want to combine
	The names of the images MUST BE UNCHANGED. Meaning, still in the form "scope_1.png", "scope_2.png", etc.

## WARNINGS:
	Will only combine up to 100 images
	Running the program will overwite any exisiting collages in the same directory
	Only reliable for images downloaded directly from the O-Scope
